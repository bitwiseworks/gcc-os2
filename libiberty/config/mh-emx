# r=bird: why this here? Should be sufficient to do -s when linking.
CFLAGS = -s -g
INSTALL = cp

# Add the "s" flag to AR_FLAGS to add an archive index instead of RANLIB
AR_FLAGS = rcs

# hack: Instead of ranlib run dllar which will make a shared library (dll)
#       TODO: Don't use RANLIB because it f**ks up install.
#       TODO: Pass the correct -g/-s flag without using non-standard stuff.
# bird: Forget this it breaks the install. We'll need a better hack.
# override RANLIB = kRx.exe dllar.cmd -cc '$(CC)' -d 'The GNU -liberty library' -o iberty -lgcc
